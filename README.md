A repo storing the statewide Oregon sythenized population, along with the 2 WA counties just across the river from Portland-Metro (Clark and Skamania).  As of this readme, these synthetic populations were developed with 2020 block data, 2018-2022 ACS data at the block group and tract level, and 2018-2022 PUMS data for the "seed" data.

Some output files have been removed due to size.  They can be recreated by running.  They are not required, they do not impact the end result.  Original seed files have been removed from each popsim run (data) folder.  The original seed files can be found zipped under "AcquiringCensus".  Larger files have been zipped to improve storage in github.  Before attempting to run or use results, review the data and output folders and unzip any files that have been zipped.
